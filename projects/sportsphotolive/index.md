#Sports Photo Live

**Sports Photo Live**

I have developed this application over the last 4 to 5 years and it has been a project that has helped to develop my skills.  This project
uses PHP as its server side code and incorporates JavaScript liberies, JQuery, SQL, FTP and several API's (Google Maps, Facebook, Twitter).  The app is
designed to support photography agencies manage match day processes connecting the photographer, club and media clients creating a single point of use.
The application supports the distribution of images through FTP protocols, publishing to social media channels and the ability to create in game match graphics.


**User Interface**

The user interface has several configurations depending on user level and type of use.  There are 4 main user types:

Agency User
Photography User
Club User 
Media User
